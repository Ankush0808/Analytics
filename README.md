I have uploaded all the images, code for the analysis of Virat Kohli stats webscraped from Cricinfo in the ipynb file and also the Virat.py file which includes the code to for the website dashboard.
<br> Prior to running the website code, please install streamlit and the respective libraries used in the code for your environment and to run the code </br>
<br> you can use the line " streamlit run Virat.py" on your code editor's terminal </br>
<br> To run it in Jupyter notebook "!streamlit run Virat.py" is the code </br>
